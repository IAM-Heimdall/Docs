### A Secure, Verifiable IAM for AI Agents
---

<br>

## Introduction - The Need for Agent Identity

Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents are transitioning from tools to autonomous actors, operating across the digital landscape on behalf of users. This evolution demands a robust way to manage their identity, permissions, and actions. Today's methods—shared credentials, static API keys, or simple User-Agent strings—fall short, creating security risks and lacking the necessary control and accountability.

This Agent Identity Framework (AIF/Heimdall) addresses this gap by establishing a dedicated identity layer for AI agents. Built on proven standards like JWT and public-key cryptography, AIF provides a standardized, secure, and verifiable way for agents to identify themselves, prove their authorization, and interact responsibly with online services.
