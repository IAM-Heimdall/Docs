## Secure Agent Lifecycle Management

- **Scenario:** An agent instance is long-running, but the user's circumstances change (e.g., they leave the company that delegated the agent, or they explicitly revoke permission for a specific task). How can access be reliably terminated? How can agent software be securely updated?
    
- **Solution Principle:** While tokens are short-lived, the underlying agent identity  and its association with the delegating user/principal need lifecycle management.A robust verifiable revocation mechanism is the key. 
    
- **Benefit:** Provides mechanisms beyond token expiry for managing agent authorization over time, responding to changes in user status or explicit revocation requests, and potentially tracking agent software versions via metadata linked to the agent identity.
    
- **Alternatives & Drawbacks:**
    

	- **Relying Solely on Token Expiry:** Doesn't handle immediate revocation needs. 
		- *Gap: Lacks immediate revocation.*
    
	- **Proprietary Agent Management Platforms:** Each builder creates their own lifecycle system. 
		- *Gap: Not standardized, no interoperable revocation signal to SPs.*
    

	- **OAuth Refresh Token Revocation:** Revokes the platform's ability to get new tokens, but doesn't target specific agent instances or delegations granularly. 
		- *Gap: Coarse-grained revocation.*
