## Standardized Trust & Reputation Signals

- **Scenario:** An SP wants to implement risk-based access control. It might trust an agent delegated by a user who authenticated with strong MFA more than one delegated after a simple email verification. It might trust agents issued by established, certified providers more than unknown ones. It needs a reliable, standard way to receive these signals.
    
- **Solution Principle:** A standardized mechanism is needed to securely convey verifiable attributes about the agent's context, such as the issuer's reputation tier, the user verification method used during delegation, or declared agent capabilities. This allows SPs to build trust dynamically.
    
- **Benefit:** Enables sophisticated risk-based policies, incentivizes responsible practices by Issuing Entities (e.g., strong user verification), promotes a healthier ecosystem by allowing differentiation based on verifiable trust signals, rather than relying solely on network factors or opaque allowlists.
    
- **Alternatives & Gaps:**
    

	- **IP Reputation/Geo-IP:** Irrelevant for assessing delegation trust or agent capability. 
		- *Gap: Wrong signals.*
    
	- **Manual SP Due Diligence/Allowlisting:** Doesn't scale to a large number of Issuing Entities/Agent Builders. Subjective. 
		- *Gap: Not scalable, not standardized.*
    

	- **Proprietary Risk Scores/Signals:** Leads to fragmentation; lacks transparency and interoperability. 
		- *Gap: Not standardized, opaque.*
