## Secure & Verifiable Delegation of Authority

- **Scenario**: An agent requests access to a user's private medical records via a healthcare API. The API provider needs irrefutable proof that the specific human user explicitly consented to this particular agent accessing this specific data for this specific purpose. Simply receiving a request from an agent claiming authorization is insufficient for high-stakes data.
    
- **Solution Principle**: There must be a cryptographically verifiable link between an agent's action and the explicit act of delegation by an authenticated principal (user or organization). This link should ideally capture the scope and purpose of the delegation.
    
- **Benefit:** Establishes a clear, non-repudiable chain of authority. Protects users by ensuring their consent is explicitly tied to agent actions. Protects SPs by providing proof of authorization before granting access to sensitive resources or actions. Essential for compliance and high-trust interactions.
    
- **Alternatives & Gaps:**
    

	- **Agent Self-Attestation**: The agent merely claims it's authorized. Completely untrustworthy. 
		- *Gap: No verification.*
    
	- **API Key Implies Delegation**: Assumes possession of a key equals authority for any action the key allows. Doesn't prove specific user consent for the agent's task. 
		- *Gap: No proof of specific user consent.*
    

	- **Standard OAuth Authorization Code Flow:** Verifies user consent for the client application (Agent Platform) to access certain scopes. It doesn't inherently create a verifiable link to a specific agent instance or the fine-grained permissions/purpose of the delegation without significant, non-standard extensions. 
		- *Gap: Focuses on client app authorization, not specific agent instance delegation proof.*
