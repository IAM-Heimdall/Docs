## Licensing & Compliance Enforcement for Agent Usage

- **Scenario**: A software company licenses an API or dataset differently for direct human use versus automated use by AI agents. They need a reliable way to enforce these terms. Similarly, regulated industries may require proof that AI accessing sensitive data meets specific compliance standards (tied to the agent model or issuer).
    
- **Solution Principle:** Access control policies check the verifiable agent identity. Policies can verify if the associated user/organization has the appropriate "agent access license". Claims within the ATK (aif_trust_tags) could also attest to the agent model's compliance certifications or the issuer's audited status.
    
- **Benefit**: Enables more future ready and possibly sophisticated licensing models based on usage type (human vs. agent). Allows enforcement of compliance requirements by verifying agent/issuer attributes against policy before granting access to regulated data or functions.
    
- **Alternatives & Gaps:**
    

	- **Terms of Service / Honor System:** Relies on users/developers behaving correctly. Ineffective against deliberate misuse. 
		- *Gap: No enforcement.*
    

	- **Heuristic Usage Analysis:** Trying to detect automated usage based on patterns. Can be unreliable, generate false positives/negatives. 
		- *Gap: Indirect, potentially inaccurate.*
