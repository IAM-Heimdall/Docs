## Proposed Solution - A Dedicated Identity Layer

Heimdall is proposed as a standardized, secure, and verifiable identity layer specifically designed for AI agents, treating them as first-class digital entities. It aims to provide the foundational infrastructure for trust and accountability in the agent ecosystem.

**Core Goals:**

- Verifiable Identity: Provide a standard way to uniquely identify agent instances and their origins.  
- Secure Delegation: Enable users to securely grant specific, revocable permissions to agents.
- Standardized Authorization: Allow services to reliably verify agent permissions.
- Transparent Accountability: Facilitate clear audit trails for agent actions.
