#### The Challenge - Identifying Agents in the Age of AI

- **Authentication**: How does a service (website, API) know it's interacting with a legitimate AI agent versus a human, a simple bot, or a malicious actor? How can it verify the agent is acting with valid user consent?
    
- **Authorization**:How can users and services grant agents specific, limited permissions instead of broad access via shared credentials or overly permissive API keys?
    

- **Accountability**: How can actions taken by autonomous agents be reliably attributed back to the specific agent instance, its provider, and the delegating user for security and compliance?

- **Trust & Interoperability**: How can services make informed decisions about interacting with diverse agents from various providers in a standardized way?


Current methods – relying on User-Agent strings (easily spoofed), IP addresses (unreliable), or sharing user credentials/static API keys – are inadequate, insecure, and non-standardized for the complex interactions autonomous agents will undertake.
